# Music-Player
The project is a music player featuring a header with three buttons (*Play All*, *Add*, and *Track Number*), along with a search input acting as a filter. The *Play All* button plays the entire list of songs, the *Add* button opens a modal window with an upload form, and the *Track Number* button, as well as the search input, currently do nothing.
